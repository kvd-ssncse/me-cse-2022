** Course Objectives
- To understand the need, design approaches for software architecture to bridge the dynamic requirements and implementation.
- To learn the design principles and to apply for large scale systems. 
- To design architectures for distributed heterogeneous systems, environment through brokerage interaction.
- To build design knowledge on service oriented and model driven architectures and the aspect oriented architecture. 
- To develop appropriate architectures for various Case studies like semantic web services, supply chain cloud services.

** Course Outcomes
After the completion of this course, students will be able to: 
- Understand the need of software architecture for sustainable dynamic
  systems and adapt to the system according to the need(K2)
- Have a sound knowledge on design principles and to apply for large scale systems(K3)
- Design architectures for distributed heterogeneous systems(K3)
- Have good knowledge on service oriented and model driven architectures and the aspect oriented architecture.(K2)
- Have a working knowledge to develop appropriate architectures through various case studies.(K2)
